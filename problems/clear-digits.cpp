You are given a string s.

Your task is to remove all digits by doing this operation repeatedly:


	Delete the first digit and the closest non-digit character to its left.


Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

Note that the operation cannot be performed on a digit that does not have any non-digit character to its left.

 
Example 1:


Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no digit in the string.


Example 2:


Input: s = "cb34"

Output: ""

Explanation:

First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".

Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 100
	s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
	The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.
