Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 
Example 1:


Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".


Example 2:


Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s consists of lowercase English letters.
