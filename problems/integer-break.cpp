Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product you can get.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.


Example 2:


Input: n = 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.


 
Constraints:


	2 <= n <= 58
