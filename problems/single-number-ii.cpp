Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
	-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
	Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
