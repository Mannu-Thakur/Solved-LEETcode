Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

 
Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]


Example 2:


Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
