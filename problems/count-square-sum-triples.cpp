A square triple (a,b,c) is a triple where a, b, and c are integers and a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

Given an integer n, return the number of square triples such that 1 <= a, b, c <= n.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5) and (4,3,5).


Example 2:


Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5), (4,3,5), (6,8,10), and (8,6,10).


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 250
