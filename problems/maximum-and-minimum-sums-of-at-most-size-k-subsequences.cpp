You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k. Return the sum of the maximum and minimum elements of all subsequences of nums with at most k elements.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 2

Output: 24

Explanation:

The subsequences of nums with at most 2 elements are:


	
		
			Subsequence 
			Minimum
			Maximum
			Sum
		
		
			[1]
			1
			1
			2
		
		
			[2]
			2
			2
			4
		
		
			[3]
			3
			3
			6
		
		
			[1, 2]
			1
			2
			3
		
		
			[1, 3]
			1
			3
			4
		
		
			[2, 3]
			2
			3
			5
		
		
			Final Total
			 
			 
			24
		
	


The output would be 24.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [5,0,6], k = 1

Output: 22

Explanation: 

For subsequences with exactly 1 element, the minimum and maximum values are the element itself. Therefore, the total is 5 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 6 = 22.


Example 3:


Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2

Output: 12

Explanation:

The subsequences [1, 1] and [1] each appear 3 times. For all of them, the minimum and maximum are both 1. Thus, the total is 12.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
	0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
	1 <= k <= min(70, nums.length)
