Given an integer n, return true if n has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return false.

An integer m is a divisor of n if there exists an integer k such that n = k * m.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explantion: 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.


Example 2:


Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explantion: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 10^4
