Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

 
Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]


Example 2:


Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []


Example 3:


Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
	1 <= Node.val <= 50
	0 <= val <= 50
