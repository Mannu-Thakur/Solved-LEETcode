You are given a positive integer n, you can do the following operation any number of times:


	Add or subtract a power of 2 from n.


Return the minimum number of operations to make n equal to 0.

A number x is power of 2 if x == 2^i where i >= 0.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 39
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Add 2^0 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
- Subtract 2^3 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
- Subtract 2^5 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.


Example 2:


Input: n = 54
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Add 2^1 = 2 to n, so now n = 56.
- Add 2^3 = 8 to n, so now n = 64.
- Subtract 2^6 = 64 from n, so now n = 0.
So the minimum number of operations is 3.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 10^5
