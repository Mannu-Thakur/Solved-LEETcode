Given the root of a binary tree, return an array of the largest value in each row of the tree (0-indexed).

 
Example 1:


Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: [1,3,9]


Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3]


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [0, 10^4].
	-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
